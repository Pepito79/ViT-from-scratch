# ViT-from-Scratch: Vision Transformer Implementation

This project is a minimalist, from-scratch implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) using PyTorch. Its purpose is to provide a clean, modular view of the ViT's core components for educational and deep understanding.


# Core Feautres

  **Patch Embedding:** Image-to-sequence transformation.
  **Positional Encoding (PE)**: Adds spatial information to the patch embeddings.
  **Transformer Encoder**: Composed of N identical blocks featuring:
        - Multi-Head Attention (MHA).
        - Feed-Forward Network (FFN).
